# Project: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

This repository contains all files and the overall progress of developing an algorithm to simulate the _**molecular dynamics of Argon atoms in a periodic lattice**_.
More specifically, the repository includes:

- **Argon_molecular_dynamics_functions.py**, which contains all the 
functions used to perform the molecular simulation, as well as other related taks.

- **Molecular_dynamics_simulation.ipynb**, which is the main notebook containing
the implementation of the molecular simulation and the calculation of relevant thermodynamic observables.

- **Simulation_Outputs**, which contains all visual results, such as dynamical simulations,
different plots, that were accomplished during the development of the project.

Responsible for the development of the current project are the MSc Applied Physics students:

**Ashley Ang, David Damianos, Stefanos Vasileiadis**
